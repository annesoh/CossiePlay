	<p>CossiePlay celebrates its fifth year of bringing characters to life through splendid costumes. A family-run business in the Hulkstown locale, we supply cosplayers’ needs in both creation of custom-made costumes and hosting of monthly cosplay parties where the most unlikely of characters come together.
	<p>Childhood favourite characters, mythic creatures from ancient legends, secret spies equipped with the tools of the trade- we translate dreams into reality, open to any kind of costume requests. Meticulous detail is woven into each of our costumes, towards the aim of making the costume envisioned by the cosplayer.</p>
	<p>Part of cosplay’s appeal is recycling and reusing materials in new creations, and sometimes used materials can be in as worthy condition as perfectly new ones. Second-hand costumes are welcomed here too, which we buy and sell.</p>
	<p>On the first Saturday of every month we hold a “CossiePlay Party” at the town hall. Entry is $15 for adults, $10 for ages 6-17 and kids under 6 are free. Each entry includes one non-alcoholic drink and a glow stick. Parties start at 6pm and run until 11pm. There is always a live DJ at the party (who takes requests) and dancing is common (but not required).</p>
